    "=16=, 2. =falda de medio paso=, a very scant skirt, fashionable at about the time of the story, and for some years later. The name came from the fact that the wearer, in dancing especially, was confined to the taking of a very short step--a half-step. _Falda de un paso solo_ explains itself in view of the foregoing.",
    "=16=, 14. =Sábado de Gloria.= Holy Saturday, the day before Easter, [p. 140] when music reappears in the Mass after its omission during Holy Week, and bells are rung at the singing of the _Gloria in Excelsis_, resumed after its suspension during Lent.",
    "=17=, 1. =Más feo que Picio= is the most common Spanish colloquialism for extreme absence of personal beauty in men. The origin of the phrase I have not been able to find. There is a story of a cobbler of the name, who was more than ugly, and so lives; but the obvious resemblance of Picio to _pez_, pitch, and to the adjective _píceo_, suggest that the man was invented after the fact, and named from his wax. For other expressions of the same kind, see Ramón Caballero, _Diccionario de modismos, frases y metáforas_, Madrid, 1898-1900.",
    "=18=, 20. =Quevedo.= Francisco Gómez de Quevedo Villegas, born 1580, died 1645; one of the greatest names of Spanish Literature--essayist, satirist, poet, wit, politician. His life and personality are not less interesting than his very varied literary work. Consult E. Mérimée, _Essai sur la vie et les oeuvres de Francisco de Quevedo_, Paris,"
