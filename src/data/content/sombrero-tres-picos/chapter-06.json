    "The present edition of _El Sombrero de tres picos_ is designed to make the book accessible as a text for use in college classes as early as the second or third semester of Spanish study. The plan of the edition needs no special comment. The editor has made the effort to include in the notes and the vocabulary explanation sufficient to cover all difficulties reasonably to be attributed to students who have done careful work in the elements of Spanish grammar, and the usual elementary reading. The numerous references in the notes are addressed more particularly to the teachers.",
    "In the use of the vocabulary, it should be borne in mind that the latter is designed for this text alone, and is in no sense a dictionary. It may be said also that an effort has been made to exclude from the notes all puerilities, and the explanation of commonplaces, whether of history, grammar, or mythology.",
    "Grateful acknowledgment is made here to the friends who have helped the editor in whatever way in the preparation of this book, and in especial to Professor De Haan of Bryn Mawr College; to Professor Caroline B. Bourland of Smith College, the editor's sister; to [p. iv] Professor William D. Briggs, of the Leland Stanford, Jr. University; to Professor Christian Gauss, of Princeton University; to the Rev. Gilbert P. Jennings, Rector of St. Agnes' Church in Cleveland, and to Don Adolfo Bonilla y San Martín, of Madrid; and lastly, and most of all, to the editor's friend and pupil, Mr. Gustav G. Laubscher, of Adelbert College, whose work on the vocabulary was more nearly collaboration than assistance."
