    "The biographical matter of this introduction is taken from two short lives of Alarcón, one by José Calvo y Teruel, prefixed to the 1870 edition of _Poesías serias y humorísticas_; and the other by Mariano Catalina, written after Alarcón's death (1905) and published with volume I (_Cuentos Amatorios_) of the _Novelas Cortas_.",
    "Of serious critical matter concerning Alarcón, I have seen, besides what is in the usual histories of Spanish Literature, [p. xvi] only the essay on _El Sombrero de tres picos_ by Luis Alfonso, prefixed to the book, in the _Colección de Escritores Castellanos_, and what is given by Padre Francisco Blanco García, in his _Literatura Española en el Siglo XIX_, 2d edition, Madrid, 1903, vol. II, pp. 452-467. Both seem unscientific, and not useful, though both have very good will; and Luis Alfonso's essay has a certain value as an historical document."
