    "=19=, 9. =broma.= For a similar use, recall Hamlet's speech: \"a fellow of infinite jest,\" etc. (Act V, Scene I).",
    "=20=, 4. =palillos=, originally _drum-sticks_, here and familiarly in Andalusia, _castagnets_ (_castañuelas_, _postizas_). =Brisca= and =tute= are two-handed games of cards popular in Spain; in _brisca_ three cards are dealt to each player, a trump is turned, and as the play goes on the hands are kept full by drawing from the pack; _tute_ is a rather more developed game of the same kind, similar in essentials to sixty-six.",
    "=20=, 6. =el que=; _sc. resultado_ in its secondary meaning, _fact_.",
    "=20=, 16. =tenía algo de ingeniero=: _had some of the qualities of an engineer, was something of an engineer_.",
    "=21=, 4. =jaraiz, lagar.= _jaraiz_ is primarily the wine-press, _lagar_ the wine-pit, where the must is preserved before the drawing off into the skin or cask.",
    "=21=, 8. =reales.= The _real_ at par was worth about five cents. It is no longer coined, but is still a favorite unit for reckoning in many parts of Spain, as the _sou_ is here and there in France. The coinage at the time of our story was the system renewed and simplified by King Charles III, about 1770. It comprised copper coins: _maravedi_ [p. 141] (34 to the _real_); _ochavo_, _cuarto_, _dos cuartos_, worth respectively two, four, and eight _maravedis_; silver coins: _real_, _dos reales_, _peseta_ (four _reales_); _medio duro_ (ten _reales_); _duro_ (twenty _reales_); and gold coins: _duro_, _dos duros_, _doblón_ (four _duros_); _media onza_ and _onza_, (eight and sixteen _duros_ respectively). The present decimal system, with the unit one _peseta_ = 100 _centimos_ was introduced in 1868. It is modeled on the system of the Latin union.",
    "=22=, 24. The reference throughout this passage is to Othello, though there is no one passage in the play where the qualities here suggested are enumerated or directly ascribed to the Moor; see, however, specially, Act II, Scene 3, Act III, Scenes 3 and 4, and the Acts IV and V. It has been suggested, in view especially of line 25, that Alarcón may have had in mind Hamlet's characterization of his father (_Hamlet_, Act I, Scene 2): \"He was a man, take him for all in all,\" etc. This seems to me to come of erroneous reading both of the lines of the play and the passage here in the text.",
    "=23=, 6. =alpargatas= are rough shoes or slippers of canvas, with hempen soles; the =montera= is a woolen peasant's cap used in many provinces of Spain, and varying in form and color with the locality.",
    "=24=, 16. =grana= is the English _grain_, familiar in English literature as late as Milton; e. g. Moryson, _Itinerary_, III, 1, IV, 96 (1617): \"The Spaniards and Portugals bought _Graine_ for Scarlet Dye.\" Cf. the present English _ingrain_ and _ingrained_.",
    "=24=, 18. _Cf._ note to =8=, 2.",
    "=24=, 22. =Fernando VII=, King of Spain, son of Charles IV and Maria Louisa of Parma. He was born in 1784, became king on the abdication of his father in 1808, was prisoner in France until 1813, was restored to the throne on the expulsion from Spain of Joseph Bonaparte, and reigned until his death in 1833. He was succeeded by his daughter, Isabella II.",
    "=25=, 8. =Constitucionales de la de 1837.= Constitutions were decreed in Spain in 1812, 1834, 1837, 1854 and 1869. The Constitution of 1837 was accepted by Queen Isabel on June 17th of that year; on its provisions, and on the events that led to its promulgation, see M. A. S. Hume, op. cit., pp. 338-340. It was an essentially radical programme, though much less broad than the Cadiz Constitution [p. 142] of 1812, and thus while it appeared reactionary and insufficient to the older Radicals, it pleased the younger Liberals with whom Alarcón cast in his lot when he first went into politics.",
    "=25=, 9. =la=, sc. _constitución_.",
    "=25=, 14. =deshollinador=, a long-handled scraper used by chimney sweeps to dislodge the soot.",
    "=25=, 16, 17. The reference in these lines is to Alarcón's own public career, and to his changes of political faith. He began as a revolutionary, and with growing years and discretion found himself in the ranks of the moderate conservatives, and a devoted royalist.",
    "=25=, 30. =las Castillas=: the Castiles, Old and New Castile. Madrid is in New Castile, the central part of Spain, reconquered from the Moors after the formation of the kingdoms of Castile, Leon and Navarre.",
    "=26=, 9. =D. Eugenio de Zúñiga y Ponce de León.= Spanish proper names when written in full regularly include the family name on both father's and mother's side. Thus D. Eugenio's father was a Zúñiga, his mother a Ponce de León. Women, when they marry, usually retain their own family name, adding the husband's with the copulative _de_; widows sign their own names, usually with the addition _viuda de_.... Thus Juana Suárez on her marriage to a Fernández becomes Suárez de Fernández; as a widow, she is Juana Suárez viuda de Fernández.",
    "=26=, 19. =desembozarse.= The Spaniard usually wears his _capa_ (cape or cloak) wrapped closely about the neck and the lower part of the face; this is _embozarse_ (=59=, 13). _Desembozarse_ is to throw back the cloak and leave the face exposed. Compare _embozo_, =46=, 28.",
    "=26=, 19. =vídose=; from _ver_. \"Han escrito buenos autores, y aun suele decir el vulgo, en el pretérito perfecto, yo vide, él vido, formas desterradas ya del buen lenguaje\" (_Gramática de la Lengua Castellana_, por La Real Academia Española, ed. 1890, p. 139, note).",
    "=26=, 25. =quirotecas.= The word _quiroteca_--etymologically _hand-case_,--[Greek: cheir thêkê]--is a jocular, almost a slang term, for misshapen gloves or gauntlets. Similar but more ephemeral expressions for gloves and especially for shoes and stockings are not uncommon in English. [p. 143]",
    "=28=, 2. =se descubrían hasta los pies=: _bowed to the ground, hat in hand; uncovered and bowed to the ground._",
    "=30=, 6. =estaba subido=. _Subido_ is here an adjective in connection with _estar_,--the nearest approach possible in Spanish to the common Romance construction of verbs of motion with the substantive auxiliary. The idea is that Uncle Lucas has climbed up and is still up. We have the same construction in =30=, 14, _estoy agarrado_, and =32=, =26=, _estoy subido_.",
    "=31=, 3. Note the pun on _mono_ \"monkey,\" and _mono_ \"pretty.\"",
    "=32=, 9. =puede [ser] que=: Cf. French _peut-être que_, _il se peut que_.",
    "=32=, 15. =pedazo de bárbaro=: _you wild man_. Compare with this use of _pedazo_ the French use of _espèce_: _espèce de vaurien_, _espèce de barbare_, etc., and _espèce de type_.",
    "=33=, 5. =ramblilla=, diminutive of _rambla_, originally the washed-out, sandy bed of a stream, left dry after freshets. The secondary meaning, \"hollow way,\" \"low path,\" comes from the use frequently made of the beds of streams in the dry season.",
    "=33=, 10. =fandango.= An Andalusian dance, very old and very lively. Compare Ford, op. cit., ed. 1845, p. 187; Pellicer, op. cit. I, beginning p."
