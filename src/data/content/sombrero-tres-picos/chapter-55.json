    "=34=, 4. =tanto bueno=, sc. _por aquí_, i. e., _so much honor done us_, lit., \"so great a good thing here.\"",
    "=35=, 8. =donde primero le coge=: _wherever it catches him_; _primero_ is an adverb.",
    "=35=, 25. =Pamplona= or Pampeluna, the old capital of Navarre, señá Frasquita's country, and a prominent border fortress, has been besieged frequently in the course of its long history. It was taken from the Romans by Euric in 466, sacked by the Franks under Childebert in 542, destroyed by Charlemagne in 778; in 907 it beat off the Moors, and in 1138 the Castilians, in the war between Alfonso VII and García Ramón II, after the dissolution of the union with Aragon; and it has been occupied not infrequently by the French, who gained possession of it by stratagem in 1808, and held it until October 21, 1813, General Cassan making a fine defence against the English and Spaniards; and it has suffered since then in the civil wars. Ignatius Loyola was one of the city's defenders [p. 144] in its siege by the French in 1521, and it is said that it was during convalescence from wounds in the hospital of the citadel that he planned the Order of Jesus. The special appositeness of Pamplona as an illustration here lay doubtless in the fact that señá Frasquita was of Navarre.",
    "=36=, 2. =Rubens.= Peter Paul Rubens, celebrated Flemish painter, born 1577, died 1640.",
    "=36=, 19. =bestia=, really a feminine noun, appears as masculine here, in =50=, 6, and elsewhere; so also _calavera_, =45=, 25, =111=, 11, and _espía_, =86=, 15. The three words are grouped in this note as being good illustrations of three stages of the same tendency: a disposition constantly more evident in Spanish to recognize association of real and grammatical gender in nouns that are of very common use. _Espía_, whose masculine signification is as old as the word itself, appears in Tolhausen's Dictionary (1891), and the thirteenth edition of the Dictionary of the Spanish Academy (1899), as both masculine and feminine. _Calavera_ is given as masculine in the transferred sense by the Academy dictionary, but not by Tolhausen; _bestia_ is exclusively feminine in both. The conclusion is clear, though it may be tempered by the consideration that _bestia_ in the figurative sense is coarser and of lower use than the other words, and so slower in achieving recognition, in spite of its appearance in the more colloquial pages of such standard authors even as Alarcón.--_un maula_, =82=, 10, is to be accounted for as _bestia_, or perhaps better, as a careless use of _un_ by the unlettered Garduña; _un ave_, p. 60, is analogical to _el ave_, a regular form; so also _un agua_, =40=, 16.",
    "=38=, 20. =Ave María Purísima.= (Cf. p. 97, title to Chapter XXVIII). By proclamation of 22d October, 1617, the Spanish Dominions in Europe and America were declared to be under the protection of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin; hence the addition of the word _Purísima_ to the _Ave Maria gratia plena_ of the prayer. Hence also, doubtless, the frequent expletive use of the words, as here, and their crystallization into formulæ of daily life, as in the other passage cited above. Hence also the frequency of the appearance of the Conception in Spanish Art. For notes of Spanish customs and rites connected with this doctrine see Ford, op. cit., ed. [p. 145] 1845, pp. 265 sqq. The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception was made part of the faith of the whole church by an apostolic Letter of Pius IX, dated December 8, 1854; it had been a matter of theological controversy since the thirteenth century.",
    "=38=, 29. =San Miguel=. St. Michael the archangel, the first and mightiest of created spirits, mentioned in the Bible in the books of Jude and Revelations. In churchly tradition he is the chief, and sometimes the sole archangel, and the one to whom was assigned the expulsion from Heaven of Satan and the other disobedient angels. His present office is two-fold: he is patron saint of the Church on earth, and lord of the souls of the dead. His feast, Michaelmas, is September 29. In art he is always young and handsome. His attributes vary with the function symbolized: as conqueror of Satan he stands with his foot upon his foe, who is always a monster, sometimes a dragon, sometimes part human, part dragon.",
    "=39=, 4. =¡Jesús, María y José!= trans.: _Mercy on us!_",
    "=40=, 24. =derritiéndosele la gacha=. Gacha is a sort of gruel made by boiling broken rice in a large quantity of milk. When it is about to boil over, a very few drops of cold water stop the boiling and bring the mass down again. This is called _derretir la gacha_. So here, _his anger fell suddenly_.",
    "=41=, 10. =Ticiano=, _Titian_. Tiziano Vecelli, born at Cadore in Venetia, 1477, died at Venice 1576; the greatest of Venetian painters.",
    "=41=, 19. =Pomona=, the Italian divinity of the fruits of trees, especially of apple-orchards. She is usually represented as a Hamadryad, young, and beloved of many rustic gods. Her worship was very important in Rome. Cf. Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, XIV, 623; Varro, _De Lingua Latina_, VII, 45.",
    "=42=, 5. =quinto=, the fifth of the six commandments or precepts of the Church, \"to contribute to the support of our pastors.\" See _Butler's Catechism_, lessons XX and XXI.",
    "=42=, 7. The =diezmo= (_tithe_) was at this time paid to the civil authority, and by it made over to the Church.",
    "=43=, 4. =Licenciado=: _licentiate_. Primarily the title given to the holders of the second academic degree; at the present time generally used in Spain, as here, to designate a lawyer. [p. 146]",
    "=43=, 12, sqq. _\"Thou hast said it,\" replied the latter, with the kindly severity of a saint, which they say he was indeed. \"An excuse unasked (is) a manifest accusation. As is the man, so are his words. But enough has been said, let there be no further speech.\"_",
    "=44=, 6. =cordonazo de San Francisco=, _the autumn equinox_, _the autumn equinoctial_; in the narrower sense, the four days preceding and the four days following St. Francis' day (October 4). It is originally a maritime expression.",
    "=44=, 16. =torta sobada=, a cake, perfectly solid, made of dough that has been very much kneaded.",
    "=44=, 17. =pan de aceite= is bread made of dough to which olive oil has been added, giving a peculiar and much esteemed taste, when the bread is fried. Or it may be used as here, of the dough.",
    "=45=, _tit_. XIII. =Le dijo el grajo al cuervo=: _The pot said to the kettle._ The full form of the proverb is: _le dijo el grajo al cuervo: quítate allá que tiznas_; and the Spanish has also the other sayings, nearer our own in form: _dijo la sartén a la caldera, tírate allá, culinegra_, and _dijo la sartén al cazo, quítate allá, que me tiznas_.",
    "=45=, 24. =pelar la pava=, _to pluck the turkey-hen_, is to stand at night under the window of the beloved, and so to make love. In Andalusia it is often called also _comer hierro_, from the bars that protect almost all windows there. Cf. R. Ford, op. cit., ed. 1845, pp. 153-154, for admirably witty remarks.",
    "=46=, 12, 15. =penitenciario, magistral=. The Canon Penitentiary, or diocesan confessor, has general charge of confessions and public penance; he is, with the Dean, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the Sacristan, and the Canon Theologian, a necessary officer of the minimum organization of the cathedral chapter; (a _collegiate chapter_ may consist simply of Dean, Secretary, Treasurer and Sacristan). Cf. Rev. S. B. Smith, _Compendium Juris Canonici_, New York, etc., 1890, Caput V, _De Adjutoribus Episcopi_, Art. VII. The Magistral, in the capitular organization, is the Canon whose special duty is preaching. Other Canons frequent in Spanish Chapters are the _Canónigo Doctoral_, the advocate and man of affairs, who must always be a doctor of canon law, and the _Canónigo lectoral_, a doctor or licentiate in theology, who expounds the Scriptures. The [p. 147] word _magistral_ has other special meanings which do not concern us here.",
    "=46=, 29. =Predicador de Oficio=, the _Magistral_; =Confesor de la Catedral=; the _Penitenciario_.",
    "=48=, 6 sqq. Compare with this chapter the conversations of Mr. Nupkins in chapters XXIV and XXV of _Pickwick Papers_.",
    "=48=, 11. =velón de Lucena=. Lucena, a town of Andalusia, in the Cabra Valley, about forty miles southeast of Cordova, is still noted for its lamps. The old-fashioned _velón de Lucena_ was a tall brass affair, with a number of wicks fitted into projecting beak-like receptacles for the oil.",
    "=48=, 22. =a lo que=. =Lo que= here = _what_; the prepositional force falls on the _que_, though _lo_ precedes. _That is what I was coming to, what I was getting at._ In form the construction is attracted from _es lo a que iba_.",
    "=48=, 25. I have not been able to find the origin or the details of the story of the \"Sargento Utrera\" or \"Sargento de Utrera que reventó de feo.\" He belongs to Andalusia, as the town name Utrera would suggest; and he shares his distinction with \"El Sargento Cruz, a quién por feo tuvieron que dar los Santos Oleos con una caña.\" For information on the whole subject I am much indebted to Sr. Bonilla y San Martín, and to Sr. D. Joaquín Hazañas y la Rua, of Seville. Cf. reference in note to =17, 1=.",
    "=49=, 27. =me las compondré=: _I will fix things up._",
    "=49=, 28. =la [batalla] de San Quintín=. St. Quentin, an important French town, eighty-two miles north-north-east of Paris, was the scene of several battles; the one referred to here was fought in 1557, on August 10, St. Lawrence's day, and was a great victory for the Spaniards, who, under the command of the Duke of Savoy, and with the aid of English, Flemish, and German auxiliaries, beat the French under Coligny and the Constable Montmorency. The Escorial was founded as a monument of the gratitude of Philip II for this victory, and dedicated to St. Lawrence.",
    "=50=, 6. =cuando te tuvo=: _When he took you_, i. e., _that he took you_, _in that he took you_. So also =84=, 18, =cuando ha ido=, _when she has gone_ = _since she has gone_. [p. 148]",
    "=50=, 27. =Pósito Real=, =Pósito Pío=. The _pósito_ was the public granary, whether national or municipal, to which regular contributions were due by law. The _pósito real_ was storehouse of forage for the army, the royal stables, etc.; the _pósito pío_ a charitable institution from which grain was lent without interest in kind (_creces_) or other charges (_recargo_), or given to widows, poor farmers, hospitals, asylums, etc. So, in the one case, the alcalde was simply behind in his taxes; in the other he had actually taken property to which under no circumstances had he any right.",
    "=54=, 12. =mañana será otro día=. A very favorite Spanish expression, used sometimes as a gently pessimistic reflection on the transitoriness of mundane things, and more often, as here, to suggest that there is no hurry about anything, and that to-morrow will take care of itself. Cf. the German: _Morgen ist auch wieder ein Tag._",
    "=56=, 5, 6. =trabuco=, =bocacha=. It is rather difficult to make a distinction in translation; blunderbuss is the word most often used in either case; _bocacha_ is really a bell-muzzled _trabuco_.",
    "=56=, 25. =rúbrica=. The _rúbrica_ is the characteristic flourish that accompanies almost every Spanish signature; it has always been regarded as highly important as an attest of genuineness, much as the seal in other countries. So _firma y rúbrica_ would be practically equivalent to _hand and seal_.",
    "=57=, 5. =con más pelos y señales=: _With more hairs and moles_; i. e., \"in greater detail.\"",
    "=57=, 18. =¡Qué burra ni qué demontre!= _What the deuce do you want with a burra!_",
    "=60=, 6. =pajarraco=. The suffix _aco_ (more usually _ajo_ or _acho_) suggests at once large size and ill-favoredness--hideousness.",
    "=62=, _tit._ XVII. =Alcalde de Monterilla=. The _monterilla_ is a small cloth cap worn by peasants. Its use here is to denote a person whose only distinction is his office, as we speak of a beggar on horseback. A \"jay-alcalde\" would be a fairly accurate rendering of the idea.",
    "=64=, 25. =de profundis=: The first words of the vulgate version of the 129 (130th) Psalm, _De profundis clamavi ad te Domine,_ etc., used in the Catholic Church as a prayer for the souls of the dead.",
    "=64=, 29. =pro=. This word is now more usually masculine. [p. 149]",
    "=66=, _tit._ XIX. =Voces clamantes in deserto.= _Voices crying in the wilderness_; compare Matthew iii, 3, Isaiah xl, 3.",
    "=66=, 1. =que soy de Archena=. Archena is a town of the old kingdom of Murcia, on the Segura, about sixteen miles northwest of Murcia. Its introduction here by Uncle Lucas has only the significance of native local pride. Compare the expression current in the United States at the present day: \"I'm from Missouri; I want to be shown.\" For the rest of the line and for a speech analogous in spirit, see Don Quijote's outbreak in Chapter XVII of the Second part: \"_¿leoncitos a mí?_ _¿a mí leoncitos, y a tales horas?_\" etc.",
    "=69=, 7. =deliberada y voluntariamente=: note the omission of the adverbial suffix. Cf. _despertar y vestirse_, =87=, 9.",
    "=70=, 12. =había=, impersonal, as proved by _colgadas_ following. _Colgadas_, adjective-participle, _hanging_.",
    "=70=, 20. =reo en capilla=. Persons under death-sentence in Spain have the regular attendance of priests, and are confined in a cell specially arranged for religious services, whence the name _capilla_. The _hopa_ is a black cassock or robe worn by the criminal at execution.",
    "=79=, 9. =¡Santos y Santas!= _Saints and Saintesses_, though effective, is scarcely English: \"male and female saints\" obviously will not do. We are constrained to twist the text a bit and translate: _Saints of heaven!_ or better, _Saints and angels of heaven!_",
    "=79=, 12. =a mí ¿qué?= _What is it to me?_ _What is that to me?_ _What do I care?_",
    "=80=, 3. =cachorrillos=. The _cachorrillo_ is a very small pocket-pistol, something on the bulldog order. The name is descriptive, being a diminutive of _cachorro_, \"puppy.\"",
    "=81=, 22. =esta es la más negra=: elliptical construction; sc. _cosa_.",
    "=82=, 10. =maula=. The word is regularly feminine. The short form of the article here is Garduña's carelessness of speech.",
    "=82=, 15. =talonazo= is a backward kick or dig with the heel; _puntapié_ a forward kick with the toe.",
    "=83=, 17. =lo que te dices=, trans.: _what you are saying_. The reflexive pronoun is used colloquially as implying the suggestion of astonishment and warning in the hearer, impertinence in the (first) speaker. [p. 150] Syntactically it seems simply expletive, as also in _se anda_, =57=, 19, and elsewhere (_sp_. =105=, 30). In _andarse_ the influence of _irse_ is apparent.",
    "=86=, 5. =si será, si será=: for classification of uses of _si_, cf. vocabulary.",
    "=86=, 19. =un alfiler de a ochavo=. _A farthing pin._ The preposition _de_ really qualifies the distributive expression _a ochavo_ which itself stands for \"los que se venden\" or \"se compran a ochavo el uno,\" or some equivalent phrase.",
    "=87=, 2. =mona=. Cf. the German _Affe_, in like sense.",
    "=87=, 14. =téngalas=; sc. _noches_.",
    "=88=, 3. _esta su casa_. The Spanish form of courtesy. A welcome visitor is always in _his own house_.",
    "=89=, 4. The expletive use of the name of the Virgin, as of others in Spanish, is well known; it may be general or with some suggestion of personal attribute, as the _Purísima_ of =38=, 20; or it may be, as here, with reference to some particular image or shrine. The same thing is true of the use of Mary as a given name in baptism; and the curious Spanish names Carmen, Dolores, Concepción, Pilar and so on, are simply the shortened form of María del Carmen, María de los Dolores, etc.",
    "=89=, 19. =bueno=, as in the vocabulary, or _he is in a pretty fix_. Cf. use of _bueno_, \"well,\" \"healthy.\"",
    "=89=, 21. =Pardo=, a royal country seat on the Manzanares, about six miles from Madrid. It was built by Charles I (Charles V), increased by Charles III, and was long a favorite shooting-box, with extensive preserves.",
    "=89=, 24. =Pedro el Cruel=. Pedro I, King of Castile and Leon, born about 1334, succeeded his father, Alfonso XI, in 1350; killed by his half-brother, Henry of Trastamara, in 1369; called also Pedro el Justiciero. Intimately associated in history with the Black Prince, John of Gaunt, and Bertrand Duguesclin.",
    "=91=, 4. =que venga a preguntar=: _should it come to ask_. The subjunctive may be taken as a condensed conditional construction, or as characteristic; in either case it is a subjunctive of result: _if so be it should come_, _in case it should come_, or _should it be of such a kind as to come_. [p. 151]",
    "=91=, 8, 9. =¡caza mayor!--¡mayúscula!= _big game!--game with a big G.!_",
    "=91=, 28. =¡Guarda, Pablo!= Expression denoting at once surprise and the recognition of need for caution. Translate, _Hold on, fellows!_ _Easy there!_ _Go slow, Johnny!_ or something of the sort.",
    "=95=, 17. =albarca.= The more usual form of the word is _abarca_. It is the roughest kind of a sandal, a simple rawhide sole, with straps covering two of the toes and fastening about the instep and ankle. The _abarca_ is very old in Spain: it is mentioned in the General Chronicle of Alfonso the Learned, ed. 1541, folio cclxii verso, and at least one King of Navarre, Sancho Abarca (905-927), had his surname from the use of it among his followers.",
    "=98=, 25. =¡Dale, bola!= A very familiar expression, denoting the irritation or disgust experienced at hearing a thing much repeated. See vocabulary, _bola_.",
    "=100=, _tit._ XXIX. =Post nubila... Diana=: _After storm-clouds, moonlight_.",
    "=100=, 5. =balcón.= The Spanish _balcón_ is not always, or indeed usually, a balcony in the English sense of the word. What is generally to be understood is a window with a railing upon which one may lean, either with or without a very slight projection beyond the wall of the house.",
    "=102=, 26. =había moros en la costa.= The expression dates from the time when raids by the Moorish pirates of North Africa were frequent on the eastern and southern coasts of Spain. It has been generalized to signify the nearly impending, and is of frequent use.",
    "=105=, 5. =mantilla=: shawl or scarf worn as a head-covering by women of Spanish countries. There are many different kinds of _mantillas_. Those worn in the cities are usually of lace, while in the country they are frequently of other materials. The one here spoken of is evidently of flannel covered with a mesh of chenille and bordered with a fringe of balls of the same.",
    "=107=, 17. =me= is dative of interest.",
    "=115=, 28. =harina de otro costal=: _flour from a different sack_; i. e., another matter, another story, a horse of a different color, another pair of sleeves. Note that the miller's wife went to the mill for her figure. [p. 152]",
    "=117=, 8. =cuarto estado=, _the Fourth Estate_, i. e., the laborers and serving-classes, the proletariat, as distinguished from the Third Estate, the Commons.",
    "=119=, 10. =arrimó una bofetada=: _handed him a blow_.",
    "=120=, 6. =San Simón y San Judas.= The feast-day of St. Simon and St. Jude, Apostles, is October 28th. Simon Zelotes the Canaanite, and Judas, also called Thaddeus, are mentioned among the disciples of Jesus, Matthew x, 3, Mark iii, 18, Luke vi, 16; and again, Acts i, 13. For a curious account of their lives and martyrdom, see Jacobus a Voragine, _Legenda aurea_, Cap. CLIX (154), ed. Graesse, Breslau, 1890, or the Temple reprint of Caxton's translation of the same work, London, Dent, 1900 (vol. VI, pp. 72 sqq.). The night of St. Simon and St. Jude is in Spain what St. John's Eve (June 23) is in most of the rest of Europe, the season when ghosts, goblins and fairies are busiest. Compare =86=, 10-12.",
    "=121=, 6. =Anteo.= Antæus, a giant, son of Poseidon and Gaia. He was invincible as long as he was on the ground, receiving added strength from the Earth, his mother, at every contact. He was killed by Hercules, who held him in the air and strangled him.",
    "=121=, 8. =énfasis.= This word, originally feminine, has become common, and is now more often found masculine.",
    "=122=, 19. =la pompa=, \"the peacock's tail,\" \"the cheese.\" The name is taken from the puffed circle made on the floor by the performer's skirts at the lowest point of the courtesy.",
    "=124=, 20. =Solán de Cabras=: thermal bath at Beteta in the province of Cuenca, about eighty miles eastward from Madrid. The Springs have been known since the sixteenth century, when herdsmen found goats \"suffering with cutaneous complaints\" bathing in the waters. Hence the name.",
    "=126=, 5. =arroba=, in dry measure twenty-five pounds; as liquid measure, varies in different provinces.",
    "=126=, 10. =Guerra de la Independencia.= The Peninsular War, 1808-1814, between England, Spain, Portugal and France. It resulted in the expulsion of the French from the Peninsula.",
    "=126=, 17. =mariscal francés.= In the first edition, General Sebastiani is named. [p. 153]",
    "=126=, 28. =Baza=: town of province of Granada, fifty-seven miles northeast of Granada, an important Moorish city, taken by Isabella the Catholic after a seven months' siege, December 4, 1489. The French under Marshal Soult defeated the Spaniards here August 10, 1810.",
    "=127=, 6 sqq. The Constitution of Cadiz was adopted in 1812, suspended at the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814, accepted by him after Riego's successful rising in 1820, and abrogated with the fall of the Liberals after the French siege of Cadiz in 1823. Ferdinand VII, _el Rey Absoluto_, died September 29, 1833.",
    "=127=, 10. The first Carlist War, ended by the Treaty of Vergara, August 31, 1839. [p. 155]",
