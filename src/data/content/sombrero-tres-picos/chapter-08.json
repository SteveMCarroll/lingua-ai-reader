    "I. ALARCÓN'S LIFE",
    "Pedro Antonio de Alarcón was born at Guadix in the province of Granada, the 10th of March 1833, the fourth of ten children of an old and noble family, whose wealth had been lost in the wars of the Napoleonic period and the disorders that had followed. His father destined him for the bar, and after reaching the baccalaureate at the age of fourteen, at the _seminario_ of Guadix, he went to Granada to begin his professional studies, only to be recalled by the _res angusta domi_ to his home, where perforce he exchanged jurisprudence for theology, and began preparation for the priesthood.",
    "The boy's heart was not in his professional studies, and his best efforts were given to other matters; he taught himself French and Italian, began to write, and formed the project of going to Madrid, to set up as a man of letters. His parents declined to support him in this ambition, but Alarcón persisted. Through Torcuato Tárrago, a young writer at that time living in Guadix, he was introduced to a Cadiz publisher, who undertook the issuing of a weekly journal, _El Eco de Occidente_, which was to appear at Cadiz and Granada, and whose literary redaction was to be entrusted to the two young men. The venture [p. vi] was successful. After three years' work the savings seemed sufficient, and on the 18th of January, 1853, Alarcón left home.",
    "He went first to Cadiz, where he gave his attention to matters concerning the journal, and a month later he reached Madrid,--without introduction or friends, but with some little money and with a goodly sheaf of verses, notably an ambitious continuation of Espronceda's _Diablo Mundo_, all of which he burned, after much interviewing of publishers. In short, he did not get along at all at the capital, and when his money was gone and the husks were sour, he made his own the immemorial custom of the prodigal, and went back to his father's house. A complete reconciliation followed his return. He had been drawn for military service: his father purchased his release, and gave him permission to live in Granada, where he renewed his connection with the _Eco de Occidente_. In Granada also he found agreeable literary society, and the year spent there was one of profit to himself and of success for his journal, in whose management he had an increasing influence and part.",
    "His first mingling in politics was in 1854, when he took open and active part in the rebellion that culminated in the mutiny of Vicálvaro (the 30th of June), distinguishing himself by his noisy and militant radicalism, and gaining the ill-will of many of the elements whose favor, in his later life, he found it wise to win--the clergy, the army, the national militia. Before the end of the year he was in Madrid, where he became the editor of _El Látigo_, the most extreme of the anti-royalist periodicals. This connection [p. vii] was ended by a duel, and Alarcón gave up politics for the time, and retired to Segovia, to restore health broken by irregular living, and to write. _El Final de Norma_ was the most ambitious work that dates from this time, with a very great number of short stories and miscellaneous articles published in various journals, all of which brought him a considerable reputation throughout Spain. In 1856 he visited Paris and \"wrote up\" the exposition of that year for the Spanish press. Towards the end of 1857 he made his appearance at the theatre of the Circo at Madrid, with his one play, _El Hijo Pródigo_. The _première_ was riotously successful, but the critics were against the author, whose personality seems to have been a large factor in the matter, and the piece was soon withdrawn. In 1859 Alarcón volunteered for the campaign in Morocco, and after doing excellent service, was honorably discharged in April, 1860, when he returned to Spain. The fruit of this military experience was the _Diario de un testigo de la Guerra de África_, which is of his best work. The book was exceedingly successful commercially, and the author's profits permitted him the journeying in France, Switzerland, and Italy, whose story is told in _De Madrid a Nápoles_, two volumes of fairly acute observation and superior literary worth. (August, 1860--February, 1861).",
    "From this time until 1873 Alarcón was devoted to an active political life, into whose details we need not follow him. He was deputy from Guadix much of the time, and was prominent as a writer for the _Época_, then as now the first conservative newspaper of Spain, and later as one of the founders and editors of _La Política_. He had much [p. viii] success, and we are told that only feelings of personal delicacy stood between him and the holding of at least one ministerial portfolio. In 1866 he was one of the signers of a celebrated protest of the unionist deputies, and was dignified by being sent into exile for a time, and afterwards being forbidden to live in Madrid. In 1863 his father died, and in 1866 he was married in Granada to Doña Paulina Contreras y Reyes.",
    "From 1873 until his death, July 18, 1891, he lived principally in Madrid, until 1888 taking a large part in literary life, and not without some mingling in matters public. In 1875, as one of the early supporters of the Alfonsine restoration, he was made Councillor of State; and on December 15th of the same year he was elected to the Spanish Academy, in which he took his seat about a year later. His pen was very active. _El Sombrero de tres picos_, _El Escándalo_, _El Niño de la Bola_, _La Pródiga_, _El Capitán Veneno_, are from this final period, which was opened with _La Alpujarra_. He gave much time also to revising, selecting, and destroying, to which process we owe the definitive collection of works noticed below. In 1887 his powers began noticeably to fail. In 1888 there was a first hemiplegia--then other attacks followed in December 1889, and February, 1890, and the final one in July, 1891.",
    "II. ALARCÓN'S WORKS",
    "Alarcón's writings have been brought together in nineteen volumes, sixteen of which are of the well known _Colección de Escritores Castellanos_. There are three volumes of short stories, the _Novelas Cortas_; four longer novels, [p. ix]",
    "_El Escándalo_, _La Pródiga_, _El Final de Norma_, _El Niño de la Bola_; two stories that are neither long nor short, _El Capitán Veneno_ and _El Sombrero de tres picos_; one volume of popular sketches, _Cosas que fueron_; three volumes of travels, _Viajes por España_, one volume, and _De Madrid a Nápoles_, two; an historic-geographical study, _La Alpujarra_; one volume of essays, _Juicios Literarios_; and one volume of verse. The three volumes outside the collection contain the celebrated _Diario de un testigo de la Guerra de África_.",
    "Of all this mass, only two works are really first-rate: _El Sombrero de tres picos_ and _El Capitán Veneno_; of the special merits of these we shall speak again presently. The diary of the African war has won praise, and so have the books of travel; an occasional short story is good; the longer novels have no permanent worth, the verse is insignificant.",
    "The most ambitious of the novels, _El Escándalo_, was published in 1875. Its author, in his _Historia de mis libros_, included in the collected works in the volume with _El Capitán Veneno_, makes a defence of this book that is most illuminating as to the principles of criticism practiced by the Spanish critics of the day, and that gives us a clear sight of the literary conditions of the time. The artistic question does not seem to have been raised: the one asked is simply as to the author's attitude toward certain other matters, chiefly of religion; and it is on the correctness of these views that the book is to stand or fall. Alarcón in his defence, accepts the situation, and joins issue: and he does this with a willingness that lets us see [p. x] that his own mind could discover no impropriety in treating literature in that way.[1] Herein lies the explanation of many weaknesses in Alarcón's work, which, given his many good qualities, might else cause us to wonder.",
    "Alarcón's best points are a very keen eye for a situation, thorough control of a language adequate to his matter, an excellent idea of the exigencies of style offered by his situations, and a keen sense of humor, which, however, occasionally goes to sleep or deserts. His weakness lies in the faulty idea of his task already pointed out, in a certain immaturity, a childish petulance that stays with him to the last, and in an utter inability to develop a character. He can picture one admirably, but he cannot make one grow; and in general, he does not try it. The one place in which he has some measure of success in this not easy task is in Don Jorge of the _Capitán Veneno_, whose struggle is very prettily exhibited; but the great, the serious effort, Fabián Conde in _El Escándalo_, falls flat. His is a metempsychosis, not a development.",
    "The Spanish language does not lend itself with much grace to the needs of the modern short story. Its leisurely diffuseness is a fair reflex of the mode of thought it represents; so Alarcón cannot, except within the four seas of Spain, be held a really good writer in this _genre_.[2] It is in the happy borderland between the long and the very [p. xi] short, that he has done his best. Finding himself for once--or for twice--with a literary task (quite unconsciously to himself, it is true) exactly fitted to his abilities, he has arrived, and succeeded. _El Capitán Veneno_ and _El Sombrero de tres picos_ are real works of art, for their author in them has shaken himself free of self-consciousness, forgotten to preach or to moralize, let ethics and politics alone and written without outward haste or inward restraint.",
    "Alarcón's work in pure literature was beyond question much hampered by his political life, and by the false notions of the aims and ends of belles-lettres into which, as he grew older, the life of the times and his own disposition caused him to fall. The history of Spain of his lifetime is a nightmare. Whether, if he had lived in happier days, he would have done better work, is one of those literary questions that are good and pleasant to think and talk over, but unprofitable to write about. Still, the constructive psychologist should have great joy in Alarcón, should he have the patience to read all his works, for the man reveals himself naked as do few; and it is most edifying to see the conservative academician of _El Escándalo_ and _La Época_ making his peace with the world and with heaven for the sins of the editor of _El Látigo_. Truly he seems to wish that we should know that he felt indeed that he had sinned much, and need make great haste."
