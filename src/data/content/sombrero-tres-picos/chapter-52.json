    "=14=, 14. =Niobe=, Queen of Thebes, it will be remembered, had seven sons and seven daughters.",
    "=14=, 16. =de las que.= The force of the preposition goes with the _que_, although _las_ precedes; that is the present state of the matter; the construction in reality goes a little deeper, being equivalent to \"de las (aquellas) de que hay\"; i. e. _one of those Roman matrons of which we still find_, or _a Roman matron, one of those of which_, etc., the stress being on the characteristics, and their implied disappearance except in the Trastevere; not merely a _Roman matron, whereof, etc._",
    "=14=, 17. =Trastévere= (from _trans Tiberim_): the quarter of Rome lying on the north bank of the Tiber west and southwest of St. Peter's, at the foot of the Janiculum hill. It is of all the districts of Rome the one least invaded by the stranger, and has preserved more than other parts of the city a certain pure-blooded Roman individuality. It has a dialect of its own.",
    "=15=, 8. =congrua= here is the temporal income that must be possessed by candidates for holy orders. The amount varies, and is fixed by the synods of the respective dioceses.",
    "=15=, 10. =menores.= The minor orders are those below the subdiaconate: _ostiariatus_, _lectoratus_, _acolythatus_; the major orders are _subdiaconatus_, _diaconatus_, _presbyteratus_. On the functions and privileges of each, see S. B. Smith, _Compendium Juris Canonici_, New York, etc., 1890. [p. 139]",
    "=15=, 15. =Don Ventura Caro=, born about 1742, died 1808. Commanded Spanish army of the West Pyrenees in 1793-94. In 1801 became Captain General of Valencia, and did valuable service in restoring and maintaining order in the province. In 1808 he repulsed an attack of Marshal Moncey on the city of Valencia, forcing a French retreat.",
    "=Castillo Piñón=, in French, _Château Pignon_, a strongly fortified position in the French Pyrenees at the northern end of the valley of Roncesvaux. It was stormed by the Spaniards under Caro, June 6, 1793. See Jomini, _Histoire Critique et militaire des guerres de la Révolution_, Paris, 1819, etc., vol. III. pp. 331 sqq.",
    "=15=, 18. =Estella=, town of Navarre, about 25 miles southwest of Pamplona.",
    "=16=, 1. =Goya.= Francisco Goya y Lucientes, Spanish painter, the greatest name in Spanish art after Velázquez, Ribera, and Murillo. He was born near Saragossa in 1746, and died at Bordeaux in 1828. He is best known for his portraits, his cartoons of popular life and customs and of the events of the Peninsular war, and for his etchings. His work may be seen to advantage at the Prado and the Academy, in Madrid, and at the Escorial. Among his paintings at the Prado is a large portrait of the family of King Charles IV, including the king himself and Queen Maria Louisa, and illustrating admirably the costume of the time--and, it may be said, writing clear in the faces the causes of the decay of Spain.",
    "=María Luisa=. Maria Louisa Theresa, daughter of Philip of Bourbon, Duke of Parma, wife of King Charles IV of Spain, born 1754, married 1767, died 1819. She is notorious in history for her evil part in the downfall of Spain, and especially for her relations with Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace. See M. A. S. Hume, _Modern Spain_, New York, 1900; chapters"
